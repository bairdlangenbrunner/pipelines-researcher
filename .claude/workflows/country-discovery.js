${s.brief}

cd ${REPO} first.

## The existing GEM roster (ALL statuses) — a candidate matching one of these rows is NOT a discovery
${ROSTER}

## Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. NEVER cite gem.wiki / globalenergymonitor.org, theodora.com, or any wikidot.com page (read for
   leads only). NEVER fabricate a URL.
2. Verify every URL you emit: \`python scripts/url_verifier.py "<url>" "<expected substring>"\` —
   emit only OK/200 + token-present links.
3. Transmission lines only — skip gathering/process/feeder lines and distribution networks.
4. Pre-filter against the roster (names, other names, endpoints). Borderline match → still emit it,
   but say which PID it might match in why_maybe_new; the consolidator decides.

## Output — write a file, then return a summary
Write ${STAGING}/discovery/found_${s.key}.json EXACTLY shaped:
{ "strategy": "${s.key}", "candidates": [
  { "name": "<best project name>", "aka": ["<other names seen>"], "sponsor": "<company or empty>",
    "from": "<start point>", "to": "<end point>", "status_guess": "<proposed|construction|operating|...>",
    "evidence": [ { "url": "https://...verified...", "date": "YYYY-MM", "note": "<what it says>" } ],
    "why_maybe_new": "<why this does not appear in the roster / which PID it might match>" }
] }
Empty candidates list is a valid result — do NOT pad with weak candidates. Before finishing, run
\`python -c "import json; json.load(open('${STAGING}/discovery/found_${s.key}.json'))"\`.
Return ONLY a 2-line summary (count found, strongest lead). The file is the deliverable.`

const QUEUE_SCHEMA = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    queue: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'object', properties: {

      required: ['slug', 'name'] } },

  },
  required: ['queue'],
}

const consolidateContract = `You are the GEM discovery consolidator for ${COUNTRY} (${COMMODITY}).
cd ${REPO} first. Read every ${STAGING}/discovery/found_*.json (strategy outputs) and
${STAGING}/discovery_context.json (the full existing-row context).

For the union of all candidates:
1. DEDUP across strategies — the same physical project found by two strategies is ONE candidate
   (merge their evidence lists).
2. MATCH-TO-EXISTING FIRST (Discovery SOP): compare each candidate against the existing rows
   (names, other_names, endpoints, specs). A likely match to an existing ProjectID is NOT a
   discovery — record it as matched (candidate name -> OtherEnglishNames suggestion for that PID).
3. The survivors form the vetting queue. Give each a short kebab-case slug (filesystem-safe).

Write ${STAGING}/discovery/queue.json:
{ "queue":   [ { "slug": "...", "name": "...", "strategies": ["news"], "note": "<1-line why new>",
                 "evidence": [ {"url":"...","date":"...","note":"..."} ] } ],
  "matched": [ { "name": "<candidate>", "matched_project_id": "P####", "reason": "...",
                 "other_names_suggestion": "<name to add>", "evidence": [ ... ] } ],
  "dropped": [ { "name": "...", "reason": "<duplicate-of-candidate / not transmission / no evidence>" } ] }
Then ALSO return { queue: [{slug, name, note}], matched: <n>, dropped: <n> } as your structured
output (the queue drives the next fan-out).`

pipeline for addition to the GEM tracker: "${q.name}" (slug: ${q.slug}).
${q.note ? `Consolidator note: ${q.note}` : ''}

cd ${REPO} first. Read your candidate's entry (evidence URLs included) in
${STAGING}/discovery/queue.json and the existing-row context in ${STAGING}/discovery_context.json.

## Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. NEVER cite gem.wiki / globalenergymonitor.org / theodora / wikidot. NEVER fabricate a URL.
2. Every URL through \`python scripts/url_verifier.py "<url>" "<expected substring>"\` before citing.
3. Corroborate with >=2 INDEPENDENT sources (not one wire story reprinted). Search in-country languages.
4. RE-CHECK match-to-existing yourself before anything else — if this is really an existing GEM row
   under another name, class it matched_existing and STOP researching a new row.
5. New owner/operator entities: \`python scripts/entity_lookup.py "<owner>" "${COUNTRY}"\` first.

## The add-threshold (Discovery SOP §3) — ALL THREE or it is monitor, not new_row:
(a) an identified sponsor; (b) at least country + region/endpoints; (c) a concrete step
(MOU signed, FEED/EPC award, permit applied, tender issued, FID). Early rumor -> "monitor".

## For a qualifying new_row, research the GEM columns
Use EXACT GEM column names (header row 3 of data/<csv named in discovery_context.json>):
PipelineName, SegmentName, OtherEnglishNames, Status (controlled vocab, lowercase), Fuel,
PipelineType, CountriesOrAreas, StartLocation/StartState/Province/StartCountryOrArea,
EndLocation/EndState/Province/EndCountryOrArea, Capacity+CapacityUnits, LengthKnown+LengthKnownUnits,
Diameter+DiameterUnits, Owner, Parent, ProposalYear, FIDStatus, ProjectLevelCost+Units,
RouteType/RouteAccuracy/RouteNotes (route research per docs/reference/route_conventions.md —
official GIS first; expansion with no new pipe -> LengthKnown=0, Diameter blank, 'no route').
Every filled value needs a verified ref in the matching "<X> [ref]" key — no orphan values, no
orphan refs.

## Output — write a shard, then return a summary
Write ${STAGING}/discovery/vetted/${q.slug}.json EXACTLY shaped:
{ "slug": "${q.slug}", "class": "new_row|monitor|matched_existing",
  "matched_project_id": "<P#### when matched_existing, else empty>",
  "name": "${q.name}",
  "values": { "<GEM column>": "<value>", ... },

  "monitor_reason": "<for monitor: which threshold leg failed>",
  "researcher_notes": "<what you confirmed, sources, confidence tier, route notes>" }
Before finishing: \`python -c "import json; json.load(open('${STAGING}/discovery/vetted/${q.slug}.json'))"\`.
Return ONLY a 2-line summary (class + strongest evidence). The shard is the deliverable.`
