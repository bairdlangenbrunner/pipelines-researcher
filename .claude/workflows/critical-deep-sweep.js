${COMMODITY} pipeline: ProjectID ${pid}. This is a deep-sweep validity pass — your job is to CONFIRM the
existing data and EXPOSE anything wrong, not to rubber-stamp it. Baird expects some of this data to
be wrong, some pipelines to not exist, and some to be duplicates or misclassified. Find those.

cd ${REPO} first.

## Inputs (read them — ALWAYS START FROM THE SOURCES THE SHEET ALREADY CITES)
- Your pipeline's current GEM values + existing refs: \`${STAGING}/worklist.json\` → load it and
  filter \`units\` to \`project_id == "${pid}"\`. Each unit has ref_col, value_cols, values,
  primary_value, current_ref, sheet_row, segment_name, pipeline_name, wiki.
- Source leads harvested from this row's gem.wiki page: \`${STAGING}/wiki_citations.json\`
  (your STARTING POINT — engage what the sheet itself cites BEFORE open-web search; verify each
  live, since many rot; READ gem.wiki for leads but NEVER cite it). A row whose only support is a
  generic/aggregate citation that does not actually name this pipeline is itself an existence flag.
- Roster of ALL ${PIDS.length} in-scope pipelines (for duplicate/relabel detection — does ${pid} look
  like the same physical pipe as another row under a different name?):
${ROSTER}

## Standing rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. NEVER cite gem.wiki / globalenergymonitor.org, theodora.com, or A Barrel Full /
   abarrelfull.wikidot.com / any wikidot.com page. Read for leads only. url_verifier rejects them.
2. NEVER fabricate a URL. If you cannot verify, say so in researcher_notes — no invented links.
3. Run EVERY url through the verifier before you cite it:
   \`python scripts/url_verifier.py "<url>" "<expected substring>" ["<more>"]\` → cite only if it
   prints OK/200 AND contains the expected token(s). Use distinctive tokens (numbers, place names).
4. Corroborate with >=2 INDEPENDENT sources (separate origins; not one wire story reprinted, not two
   pages both tracing to GEM). tier: high = >=2 independent working+value-present; medium = 1 strong;
   low = 1 weak/partial/conflicting. Search in the country's languages too where English is thin.

## What to do, IN THIS PRIORITY ORDER (existence + classification FIRST)
1. EXISTENCE — Is this pipeline real? Find independent evidence it physically exists/is being built.
   If the ONLY traces are GEM-derived, or the sheet's cited source does not actually name this
   pipeline, or you cannot find independent confirmation, flag verdict="concern",
   concern_type="existence" (possible hallucination / GEM-only entity).
2. CLASSIFICATION — Is it correctly classified as recorded (right commodity; a transmission trunk vs
   a gathering/process/feeder line)? Wrong → concern_type="classification".
3. DUPLICATE — Compare against the roster. If ${pid} is very likely the same physical pipe as another
   ProjectID (relabel / segment double-count), flag concern_type="duplicate" and NAME the other PID.
4. ATTRIBUTION — owner/operator, FuelSource, province, endpoints. Wrong → concern_type="attribution".
5. SPEC — length, diameter, capacity, dates. CRITICALLY confirm each against >=2 independent sources.
   It is NOT enough that a page mentions the pipeline — the source must AGREE with the GEM number.
   Material disagreement → concern_type="spec", verdict="concern" (never silently pass it).
Also DEEP-FILL genuinely blank value fields with a paired, verified ref (best-effort; do not force a
number on weak fields like Capacity — leave blank rather than fabricate).

A pipeline that is real and correctly classified but has a lesser caveat → verdict="confirmed (caveat)".
Only open existence/duplicate/classification doubt → verdict="concern".

## Output — write a shard, then return a summary
Write \`${STAGING}/rows/${pid}.json\` = a single JSON object EXACTLY shaped like:
{
  "project_id": "${pid}",
  "pipeline_name": "<from worklist>",
  "sheet_row": <int from worklist>,
  "wiki": "<gem.wiki url from worklist>",
  "validity": [
    { "segment_name": "<or empty>", "verdict": "confirmed (caveat)|concern",
      "concern_type": "existence|duplicate|classification|attribution|spec|none",
      "recommendation": "<short human next step, e.g. 'reclassify as NGL' / 'merge into P####' / 'verify endpoint'>",
      "researcher_notes": "<the full finding — what you checked, what the sheet's own sources say, what independent sources say vs GEM, your reasoning>",
      "proposed_refs": ["https://...verified..."], "tier": "high|medium|low",
      "independent": true, "source_language": "en" }
  ],
  "fills": [
    { "segment_name": "<or empty>", "sheet_row": <int>, "ref_col": "Capacity [ref]",
      "value_cols": ["Capacity"], "primary_value_col": "Capacity", "values": {"Capacity": "<val>"},
      "primary_value": "<val>", "proposed_refs": ["https://...verified..."],
      "verifications": [{"url":"https://...","ok":true,"contains_value":true}],
      "class_out": "REFS_ADDED|UNRESOLVED", "tier": "high|medium|low", "independent": true,
      "source_language": "en", "researcher_notes": "<why this value / source>" }
  ],
  "summary": "<one line>"
}
Emit at least one validity object per pipeline (use verdict="confirmed (caveat)", concern_type="none"
if you found nothing wrong, summarizing what you confirmed). validity[].proposed_refs and all
fills[].proposed_refs must have passed url_verifier. Before finishing, run
\`python -c "import json; json.load(open('${STAGING}/rows/${pid}.json'))"\` to confirm it parses.
Return ONLY a 2-line summary: the verdict/concern_types you staged, and any UNRESOLVED. Your shard
file is the deliverable, not your message.`
